# smartcrypto_tradingbot

Objective
This project aims to enhance cryptocurrency trading using AI-driven predictions. The key objectives are:

Improve Prediction Accuracy â€“ Utilize advanced machine learning techniques to forecast price movements.
Manage Risk Effectively â€“ Reduce trading risks by leveraging predictive models.
Increase Profit Potential â€“ Optimize buy/sell decisions for better profitability.
Make Smarter Trading Decisions â€“ Provide AI-driven insights for informed trading strategies.
Project Overview
This project consists of three main parts:

Trend Prediction (Training_Model_Trend.ipynb)

Uses trading strategies and LSTM to predict market trends.
Price Prediction & Buy/Sell Signals (Train_BuySignal.ipynb)

Trains a model to identify optimal buy and sell signals.
Results can be observed in Final.ipynb and With_trend.ipynb.
Automated Trading & Backtesting

Final.ipynb â€“ Predicts price movements and allows trading directly in your Binance account using your API key and secret.
With_trend.ipynb â€“ Combines trend and price predictions for more complex analysis. While trend prediction accuracy may not be extremely high, this approach offers additional insights for traders.
Backtest.ipynb â€“ Enables backtesting to evaluate model performance before live trading.
This project provides both automated trading and strategy backtesting, allowing users to make informed trading decisions with AI assistance. ðŸš€
